**Dataset:** Medical Costs Dataset

## Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
Yes, the notebook is structured well and easy to follow. I would use a subplot though for the Section 2.1 histograms to have them side by side and not on top of one another. It is not totally clear which region gets encoded to which number, but region was not used so this isn't a major issue.

## Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
Yes they make sense. Age, bmi, and smoker are the three I used in my analysis, and sex makes sense as well. The categorical features were encoded properly to be used for linear regression analysis.

## Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
Yes almost everything is clearly thought out and explained, whether it was in markdown cells, code comments, or reflections. They are missing the 5.3 Comparison of the models though. It is somewhat included in the Reflection 5, but not fully.

## Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
Yes, he was brief but concise, and I thought his insights were conveyed well. He did leave out his overall findings in Section 6.1 though.
